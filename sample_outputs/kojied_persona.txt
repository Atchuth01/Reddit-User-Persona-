🌀 Behavior & Habits:
 - Not in Chelsea but Washington square park has the pigeon whisperer. Bear in mind he’s definitely eccentric and curses a lot so might not be a family friendly guy to talk to.
Also the corner of 46th and 6Av always has insane number of pigeons. Like a lot.
 - The optimal strategy I've discovered is the following

1. rush artist/writer slots and fill them
2. rush renaissance era via acoustics
3. bulb writer to fill rationalism slots
4. if AI wants to be friends, accept (unless negative impact with neighboring civs) and do research agreement
5. internal food routes (usually to city with artist slots)
6. pay neighbors to fight eachother (so you don't get attacked)
7. rush and work science buildings
8. 7 turns (10 if standard speed) after building and rushing research lab (and working the slot), bulb science, beeline for stealth bombers. (if you have a religion use faith to buy 3-4 scientists)
9. if you have the capacity, build out military buildings (up to military academy) so you have air repair
10. go dominate or yeet off to space

I'm usually ahead of AI by the time I build research labs (although they may have more total techs since they fill the science tree more balanced), and left them in the dust when I bulb

It does get a bit boring after a while though, so I'm trying to find ways to diversify the gameplay.
 - Whole pie is always better than a slice. You can get a good sit down pie between two people, or to take home. 

Whole pie: John’s on Bleecker (usually 30 min wait)  

 Slice: Lucia Pizza of SoHo (Caramelle Piccanti)

😤 Frustrations:
 - Can't wait for Vision Air 5 launching in 2034 with these transparent displays!
 - So in general each family will eat each type of food equally. Which means those with low supply are more likely to be consumed first.

Eggs I believe each plot only produces one per month, so it's helpful, but won't be sufficient to maintain food diversity
 - \- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here  
\- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that  
\- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  
\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  
\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT

I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead

🎯 Goals & Needs:
 - 50k at a time? I want to transfer from Robinhood, but WB only allows 50k transfers at a time. Each transfer which takes 5 days needs to be completed before I can transfer more. 
Is there no way to transfer 50k per day?
 - Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
Also I just store ale at the tavern or keep it in the brewery for this reason
 - The Coach USA bus takes you to Penn station, Bryant Park, or Grand central. If there's 4 of you I'd suggest an uber though, since the price point isn't that different.  
If you still want to take the bus, download the Coach USA, and buy the tickets in advance. Or pay by cash at the bus stop. It's a bit hard to find though, so might want to ask around as well.
